# Using-Set-to-represent-Propositions

## Introduction

Any Propositions can be represented by sets. If any proposition's truth value is `T`, it is a SUBSET of REAL WORLD. Otherwise, if its truth value is `F`, it should be regarded as `NULL SET`.

## Using my model to analyze Monty-Hall Problem.

A set, or a `Proposition`, could be denoted by an ellipse.
