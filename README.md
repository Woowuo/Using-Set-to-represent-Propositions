# Using-Set-to-represent-Propositions

## Introduction

Any Propositions can be represented by sets. 
1. If any proposition's truth value is `T`, it is a SUBSET of REAL WORLD. 
2. Otherwise, if its truth value is `F`, it should be regarded as `NULL SET`.
3. If `p->q` is `T`, then `p` is `SUBSET` of `q`.
4. If `p->q` is `F`, then `p` is `NOT SUBSET` of `q`.
5. If `p` and `q` are intersected, they are `CONTINUOUS`.

## Using my model to analyze Monty-Hall Problem

A set, or a `Proposition`, could be denoted by an ellipse. If information of a set is KNOWN, it can be denoted by
